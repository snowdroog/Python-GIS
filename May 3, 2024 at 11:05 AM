# Spotfire automatically handles data loading for data functions.
# Assume GENSCAPE_PIPEFLOW_REPORTS is available and correctly loaded as per Spotfire's data function settings.

# Filter records where RankReal is 1.00
filtered_data <- GENSCAPE_PIPEFLOW_REPORTS[GENSCAPE_PIPEFLOW_REPORTS$RankReal == 1.00, ]

# Create a sequence of dates for the next 12 months from the most recent date in the data
start_date <- max(filtered_data$Date, na.rm = TRUE) # Use the most recent date from the data
end_date <- start_date + 365 # One year later
date_sequence <- seq.Date(from = start_date, to = end_date, by = "day")

# Expand data to create a row for each date for each region
prodForecast <- expand.grid(Date = date_sequence, Region = unique(filtered_data$Region))
prodForecast <- merge(prodForecast, filtered_data[, c("Region", "AvgTop10")], by = "Region", all.x = TRUE)

# Rename AvgTop10 to Production and finalize the prodForecast table
prodForecast$Production <- prodForecast$AvgTop10
prodForecast$AvgTop10 <- NULL

# The output object 'prodForecast' will be automatically recognized by Spotfire if configured as output in the data function settings.
